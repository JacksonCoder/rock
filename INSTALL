Note: rock will install a launching script to /usr/bin/ by default,
and its manpage to /usr/man/man1 (on *nix platforms)

You can change the prefix by running PREFIX=/usr/local/ sudo make install
for example, or even install it by hand (it's not that hard)

You have a -source release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'make bootstrap && sudo make install'

You have a binary release (e.g. rock-X.X.X-linux32, rock-X.X.X-win32, etc.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'sudo make install'

Troubleshooting
---------------

Help! rock doesn't find its sdk!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's how rock tries to find it:

1) If the ROCK_SDK environment variable is set, take that path
2) If the ROCK_DIST environment variable is set, take $ROCK_DIST/custom-sdk
3) If none of the above are set, tries to locate itself and tries ../custom-sdk
   (works if you've symlinked the rock executable to /usr/bin or something.)

Help! rock doesn't find its libraries!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only lib rock depends on is the Boehm GC (if you don't turn it off
via -gc=off)

We have static binary builds of the Boehm GC for most platforms/archs,
look in rock/libs/

If we don't have your platform/arch, try to install the Boehm GC yourself,
and compile with -gc=dynamic (it'll link with -lgc instead of the static
binary builds)
