# Rock extensions

Extensions are pieces of code not strictly necessary to ooc
programs compilation and execution. However, some of them may
be very useful.

They typically have more dependencies than the rest of rock,
which is why they live here - as a rule, once compiled, they
should be easy to use, though.

For information on each extension, refer to the extension-specific
README.
