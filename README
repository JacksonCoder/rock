rock
====

rock is an ooc compiler written in ooc - in other words, it's
where things begin to become really exciting.

'r.o.c.k' stands for 'rapid ooc compiler without kludges'.
Also, it's short and it sounds cool.
If you can think of a better acronym, let us know.

It should compile fine under the latest j/ooc,
which you can get at http://github.com/amoswenger/ooc

When rock is be stable enough, we're going to ditch j/ooc for good
and happily live as chicken and egg forever.

Progress report:
  - 2009-06 : Basic structure, it's gonna be some time till it can do anything useful
  - 2009-09 : The tokenizing code is all there, and it's working simply great.
			  Now onto constructing AST nodes.

You can help! We can probably re-use like 50% of the source code from the
j/ooc codebase, so please come on #ooc-lang to know which classes need porting.

Porting is not-so-hard, just refer to the cheat sheet here: http://ooc-lang.org/cheat

P.S: Did I mention bootstrapping is awesome?
P.P.S: If this project description isn't formal enough for you, then rock
is probably not ready for you yet. Or the other way around. Or not. Who knows.
