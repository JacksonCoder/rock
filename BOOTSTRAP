Bootstrapping
=============

So you just checked out the rock git repository and ran `make` to
get a fancy executable. Nice try, but ...

rock is a *self-hosting* compiler, ie. it's written in ooc, and we
use rock to compile rock, and so you also need a rock executable to
compile rock.
True, it sounds complicated, but it doesn't have to be. There is
an online service called *alpaca* that automatically detects commits
on our git repository, fetches all changes and compiles rock for you.

To ensure compatibility across platforms, it also generates a
tarball of rock's generated C sources. Just download them, extract them
and run `make` again.

Visit the alpaca at:

Fetch the `C sources for manual bootstrapping` - or just use this link:

    http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/rock-linux/rock-bootstrap-only.tar.bz2

Extract, run `make` again. Enjoy.
